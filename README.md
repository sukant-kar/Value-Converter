# Value-Converter
Its name can be a bit confusing to understand, but the project in itself
is very easy to make. The script that we will make within this project,
will be used to perform some common conversions between different
measurement units, like Celsius to Fahrenheit, rupee to pound,
centimeter to foot, etc. 

Initially, this script will only be able to perform some basic
conversions that require very basic mathematics. But as you improve your
programming skills, and get introduced to the NumPy library, you can add
the functionality of doing some more complex conversions like
calculating the area and perimeter of a circle with a given radius. (you
would need the value of pi for this conversion, which you can get from
the NumPy library)
